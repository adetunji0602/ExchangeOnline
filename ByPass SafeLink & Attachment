Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) Bypass Rules
If you are using Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) in your mail environment and have experienced false clicks or false attachment opens, it is because ATP has link processing and attachment processing rules that are causing this. You can set up additional mail flow rules that allow you to bypass safe links and attachments processing for phishing test emails from KnowBe4's IP addresses. However, if you have a mail filter in front of your mail server, we recommend you whitelist in ATP by email header instead.
 
Note:
We recommend that you allow an hour for the rules to circulate to all of your users. To test out your rule, set up a phishing campaign for a small test group that includes yourself prior to starting a phishing campaign.
